# never-the-me-the-odds

This project empirically estimates the probability of user selected metrics on user defined dice rolls for the Star Wars Fantasy Flight Games roleplaying game. 
By default, 1000 independent rolls are simulated and the probability is defined as the number of roll satisfying the query parameters within that sample.

This project uses Python Flask for the back-end and jQuery and AJAX for the front end.
